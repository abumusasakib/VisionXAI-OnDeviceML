# VisionXAI

A Flutter application with dynamic localization, BLoC state management, Hive for persistence, and routing.

---

## Key Components of this Project

### 1. **Localization Support**

- Localization with `flutter_localizations`.
- ARB files are located in `lib/l10n`.
- Code generation uses `flutter_gen_runner`.

### 2. **State Management**

- Using `flutter_bloc` and `bloc` for managing application state.

### 3. **Persistence**

- Using `hive` and `hive_flutter` for lightweight storage.

### 4. **Dynamic Routing**

- `go_router` for navigation and dynamic route handling.

### 5. **Utilities**

- `intl`: For formatting dates and numbers based on locale.

### 6. **Code Generation Tools**

- `build_runner`: For code generation.
- `flutter_gen_runner`: Automatically generate localization code.

### 7. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**

- **Android**, **Windows**, and **Web** apps can be built and run seamlessly.
- The app is designed to be functional on **mobile**, **desktop**, and **web** platforms.

## Run the Pre-configured Project in Docker

Ensure you have Docker installed and running in your system and you are inside the `vision_xai` directory of the project. It is recommended that a stable and high-speed internet is there while using Docker to configure the project. You may need to run Docker as superuser if on Linux.

### Automating build using Node.js

You need to have Node.js installed before using the setup build scripts.

#### How It Works

- **Platform-Specific Check**: The shell and batch scripts handle the initial check for Node.js.
- **Installation Prompt**: If Node.js isn't installed, the script provides a link and exits.
- **Running the Node.js Script**: Once Node.js is confirmed to be installed, the script proceeds to execute `setup.js`, which will handle the rest of the setup.

#### Usage Instructions

1. **macOS/Linux**: Run `chmod +x setup.sh` to make the shell script executable, then execute it with `./setup.sh`.
2. **Windows**: Double-click the `setup.bat` file, or run it in Command Prompt. To run the setup script on Powershell, use `./setup.bat`.

### Running the Docker Compose

1. **Build and Run the Docker Container**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   OR

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build the Docker image, run the container, build the APK, and copy the release apk to the `./build` directory on your local machine, as well as run a web server to serve the web version of the app.

   This would take a very long time; so please be patient. All processes will be finished as soon as it accepts connections for the Flutter web app.
2. **Access the Flutter Web App:**

   After the build completes and the web server starts, you can access the Flutter web app by opening your web browser and navigating to:

   ```text
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

   To exit, press Ctrl+C twice.

### **Key Directories**

- **`lib/`**: Contains all the application logic, widgets, and business logic.
- **`android/`**: Contains Android-specific configurations and resources.
- **`web/`**: Contains web-specific resources, including `index.html`.
- **`windows/`**: Contains Windows-specific build configurations and app runner files.
- **`assets/`**: Holds images and other static resources.
- **`test/`**: Includes unit and widget tests for validating app functionality.

This directory structure ensures clarity, modularity, and scalability, making it easier for developers to navigate and maintain the **VisionXAI** project.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all project dependencies:

```bash
fvm flutter pub get
```

---

### Generate Localization Files

To generate the Dart localization code from the ARB files, run:

```bash
fvm flutter pub run build_runner build
```

This will generate the `app_localizations.dart` file in the `lib/l10n` directory.

---

## Building and Running the Application

### **Android**

1. Ensure you have the Android SDK installed and configured.
2. Run the following command to build the APK in release mode:

   ```bash
   fvm flutter build apk --release
   ```

3. The generated APK will be located in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory.
4. To build an **AAB** (Android App Bundle) for uploading to the Play Store, use:

   ```bash
   fvm flutter build appbundle --release
   ```

---

### **Windows**

1. Ensure you have the Windows desktop development environment set up, and the `flutter_windows` plugin enabled.
2. Run the following command to build the Windows executable in release mode:

   ```bash
   fvm flutter build windows --release
   ```

3. The executable will be located in the `build/windows/runner/Release/` directory.

To **run** the app on Windows, use:

```bash
fvm flutter run -d windows
```

---

### **Web**

1. **Serve the Application**:
   To serve the app locally for testing, run:

   ```bash
   fvm flutter run -d chrome
   ```

   This will start the app in a web browser on your local machine.

2. **Build for Release**:
   To build the app for deployment on the web, use:

   ```bash
   fvm flutter build web --release
   ```

   The built files will be located in the `build/web/` directory. These files can be deployed to any web server.

---

## Additional Notes

1. **State Management with BLoC**:
   - The app uses **BLoC (Business Logic Component)** for state management in the project. This helps in keeping the UI layer separate from the business logic.
   - Each feature (like Home or Settings) has its own `Cubit` and `State` file to handle specific functionality, making the code modular and easier to maintain.

2. **Localization**:
   - The `l10n/` folder is dedicated to managing the app's language and translations. Each supported language should have an ARB file for storing translated strings.
   - `flutter_localizations` is used to dynamically switch languages based on user preference, and the `flutter_gen_runner` tool is used to generate the Dart localization files automatically.

3. **Persistence (Hive)**:
   - The app uses **Hive** for storing user preferences in a lightweight and efficient manner. This is managed inside the `settings/` folder where the user's preferences are saved and loaded.

4. **Routing with `go_router`**:
   - The app uses the **`go_router`** package for navigation and route management. This package is ideal for handling nested routes and providing a declarative approach to routing.

5. **On-Device Machine Learning (TFLite) & XAI**:
   - **Local Inference**: The app executes local, on-device Bangla image captioning using the TensorFlow Lite Interpreter (`tflite_flutter`). It loads the exported models (`feature_extractor.tflite` and `decoder.tflite`) and the vocabulary mapping (`vocab.json`) directly from the application's assets.
   - **Asynchronous Isolates**: Model loading and image captioning inference are offloaded to background Dart isolates using `Isolate.run(...)` to prevent UI thread freezing (jank) and ensure a butter-smooth user experience.
   - **XAI Attention Painter**: The application provides Explainable AI (XAI) capabilities by visualizing the model's visual attention weights for each word. An `AttentionPainter` generates a Jet-colormap heatmap overlaid on the image.
   - **Whole Image Visualizer**: Selecting a word via the `ChoiceChip` list updates the image display with its attention plot. The user can also tap on the image to view the overlay on the *whole* uncropped image inside a preview dialog. A custom `FutureBuilder` resolves the image's raw dimensions and scales the attention map precisely onto the uncropped pixels using an `AspectRatio` box wrapper.
